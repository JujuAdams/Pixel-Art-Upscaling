<h1 align="center">Pixel Art Upscaling Shader</h1>

GMS2 Port of a pixel art upscaling shader, designed to scale pixel art to awkward resolutions using non-integer scaling factors. The original shadertoy source can be found [here](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ltBGWc) and further described in [this video](https://hero.handmade.network/episode/chat/chat018/). More pixel art filtering shaders/functions can be found [here](https://jorenjoestar.github.io/post/pixel_art_filtering/) (it's a really good page, give it a look).
